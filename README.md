# Pune-Metro-System
The Python-based Pune Metro System project optimizes navigation through graph and heap data structures. Focused on four key corridors, it ensures seamless travel in Pune's urban landscape by efficiently representing stations and corridors in a graph for streamlined route calculations and intuitive visualization.

Notably, the Pune Metro encompasses four corridors, each serving as a crucial artery in the city's transportation framework:
<br>1.	PCMC to Swargate
<br>
2.	Vanaz to Ramwadi
<br>
3.	Hinjewadi to Shivaji Nagar
<br>
4.	Chakan to Wakad
<br>
These corridors, pivotal in connecting various parts of the city, are integrated into the graph representation of the metro network, providing users with a comprehensive understanding of the metro's vast expanse. By encapsulating metro stations as vertices and the corridors as edges, the project not only facilitates efficient route calculations but also offers users an intuitive visualization of the interconnected metro system. This report delves into the core functionalities of the code, shedding light on how the Metro System project optimizes metro navigation for the diverse and dynamic city of Pune.
